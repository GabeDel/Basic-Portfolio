        <!-- Paragraphs About Myself -->
        <p> My name is Gabriel Delgado. I was born in Chihuahua, Mexico. Fun fact, I don't look like any of my family members, so my parents tell me im adopted. Ha Ha. I am a huge fan of footbal. I love playing it and watching it. My favorite teams to watch and to follow are Real Madrid F.C and Liverpool. I decided for this information not to be known to the class after the hostility that was shown to my other classmaste by Marius. </p>

        <p> Another thing I am interested in other than footbal is fashion. To me, being able to dress however you like speaks really loudly for the type of person you are. When I first meet someone, i atomatically see how they are dressed. I dont know whether this is a good thing or not. I dont judge though. Talking about fashion, I dont just like it for how somethng or someone looks. I also like creating clothing. Being able to wear something you created feels really good.  </p>
